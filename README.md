# Fart.exe

## Introduction

A forked version of fart.exe (https://github.com/lionello/fart-it) original developed by Lionello Lunesu. I took the project, loaded it into Visual Studio 2019, fixed one issue relating to C++ version, and ignored deprecated issues. The sln will build for x64 and ARM64 in Windows.

## Installation

Run fart.exe from the Windows command line. For more information, view the author's homepage: http://fart-it.sourceforge.net/
